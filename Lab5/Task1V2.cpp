//#1: Write a function in C++ to check if a number is prime.
//A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 with only two positive factors â€“
// themselves and 1 and that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.
//Number is either composite (4,6,8,9,...) or prime(2,3,5,7, 11, 13).
//The definition of a prime number is any number that has no positive divisors other than itself and the number 1.
// A negative number can not be prime because when it is divided by 1, the result is a another negative number.

using namespace std;
